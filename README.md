Hey there!

I'm Isis, 23 years old, and I'm studying back-end and full-stack programming.

## 🔧 Technologies I Use

Here are some of the technologies I work with and enjoy:

- **Python** 🐍  
  A powerful and versatile programming language, ideal for web development, data analysis, automation, and artificial intelligence.

- **Java** ☕  
  A robust, general-purpose language widely used for corporate applications, Android apps, and complex systems.

- **JavaScript** 💻  
  The essential language for front-end web development, known for its flexibility and ability to create interactive experiences in the browser.

- **Angular** 🔶  
  A powerful framework for building single-page web applications (SPA), with support for TypeScript and rich functionality for developing dynamic and scalable applications.

- **HTML & CSS** 🌐
